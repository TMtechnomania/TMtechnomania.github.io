				<h2>Join the Dev Journey!</h2>
				<h4>Unveiling the Creator Behind the Code</h4>
				<p>
					Greetings, I'm Kartikey, a self-made Chrome Extension
					maestro, crafting tools to elevate your browsing experience.
					With over 5 extensions featured on the Chrome Webstore, I'm
					on a solo educational journey, juggling studies,
					freelancing, and side hustles to fuel my passion.
				</p>
				<p>
					I stand by the belief that tools should be free and
					accessible to all. However, maintaining this freedom poses
					challenges. To sustain and enhance this journey, your
					support can be a game-changer! Every donated penny keeps the
					flame alive and ensures that these tools remain freely
					available to the community.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your support, whether through a donation or by spreading the
					word across the vast expanse of the internet, can shape the
					wonders in our online lives. Let's build together and make
					the web a better place for everyone!
