Additional Notes
Gaming Focus: I prioritized major, cross-platform stores that are popular and accessible. If you want to include console-specific ones (e.g., PlayStation Store, Xbox, Nintendo), let me know for swaps.
Total Reduction: Dropped to 5 per category as requested, removing one from each (e.g., Zoom from Productivity, Discord from Social, etc.) to streamline.
Implementation: This list can be stored in a new file like websites.js as an array of categories with site objects (name, URL, icon). For the popup, use a grid layout with categories as headers.
User Customization: In the future settings panel, allow users to enable/disable categories or add custom sites.
